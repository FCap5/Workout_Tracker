# Workout_Tracker

## A Fairly Short Assignment

With most of the starter code provided, this app really boiled down to four things things:

1. Setting up the server file
2. Writing the API routes
3. Seeding the data to a mongo db
4. Launching on Heroku

## Getting Started

Setting up a server file was very easy. It was basically the same format as the SQL server files we'd been working on for the last month or so. All I needed to do was add some additional code specific to Mongo. I through in my app.use for html routes and API routes and I was good to go.

## API Routes

These were fairly straight forward as well. It took a minute to figure out which API routes I needed. I went into the front end js files and executed a search for "API." From that I knew I needed to write 4 API routes and what their functions were. I executed those API routes.

## Setting up the DB

this gave me the most trouble. I thought I'd just be able to type NPM run seed and it would work, but I needed to set up a DB in compass, which I'm not familair with. The online resources for this were a bit difficult to sift through. It seems that Mongo is into providing as many detailed tutorials on higher-level ideas and concepts as they can, but don't like to do tutorials on setting up a simple db connection.

## Launching to Heroku

Forutantely, a very helpful tutorial for this was provided on our Gitlab, so I followed those steps and it was done.
